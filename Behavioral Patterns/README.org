#+title: Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are [[id:d5e06849-0ff0-4c9d-8282-c2181722cf92][design patterns]] that are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of
responsibilities between objects. Behavioral patterns describe not just patterns of objects or classes but
also the *patterns of communication between them*. These patterns characterize complex control flow that's
difficult to follow at run-time. They shift your focus away from flow of control to let you concentrate just
on the way objects are interconnected.
